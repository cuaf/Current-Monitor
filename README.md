INA196 Current Sensor
======================

Provides current and voltage measurements based on the voltage drop over a low resistance shunt resistor (e.g. 1 milliohm). 
Small boards arriving soon, cheap to use and make from TI's generous sample offers.

We can use these to measure the motor curent, and probably the avionics power supply too.
